This repo contains an Rscript for plotting of pncA feature data (pncA_features) and for training machine learning models on
this data.

I recommend downloading and running in RStudio, as it has a nicer user interface and is easier to run individual parts of the
script to see how each step works. In addition, this will allow you to easily try different models and training parameters to
see if you can improve the model or use it for your own purposes.
